				"responses": [
					"My old portfolio site was built with Astro, React and TailwindCSS. My new portfolio site (this one) was built with SvelteKit, DrizzleORM and Tailwind CSS. I've enjoyed working with SvelteKit a lot because there's a lot less boilerplate as opposed to React or NextJS, and I feel that runes and writables are much easier to work with than hooks and contexts. Additionally, the SvelteKit team has crafted a beautiful and intuitive developer experience, and I'm really excited to see what they build in the future!",
