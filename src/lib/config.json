					"Being of Habit is a holistic health and wellness platform that aims to explore 3 central pillars of life: fitness, nutrition and well-being. It was conceptualised by girlfriend Ishita, aiming to explore the latest in the health and wellness space, drawing inspiration from evidence-based podcasts, books, publications, social media and more.",
					"The platform was originally created using SquareSpace, which lacks the flexibility that Ishita wanted. As a result, we started rebuilding the platform using NextJS and TailwindCSS. Additionally, we created a simple CMS (Content Management System) to allow the website's blog section to be managed easily.",
					"I also took this project as a learning opportunity; I explored potential technology stacks and analysed them to choose what I felt would be the best fit for the project. I also gained hands-on experience with the AWS and Terraform, which I used to deploy our custom CMS.",
